C++ - Summer Course Ex2 Tester.
version 1.0

Created by Ofek Rafaeli

Feel free to improve the tester and to share it.

Installation:
1. Unzip everything to the directory on which same level as your c++ program files (everything that
is in the tar - tests.py, README, file_tests, school_reader)

2. Open  the running directory in the shell (navigate to the location your files are located)

3. Run the following: python tests.py


note that the tester assumes you have a valid makefile that compiles your code correctly.
essentially, the tester runs your solution and the school solution on a bunch of files, and
compares the two.

We have 3 tests:

1. school_examples - running tests that were given to us by the school.

2. negative syntax - testing whether or not you correctly identify problematic (ie- negative value)
inputs. note that you might act correctly while not printing the exact format the school does - and
thus it is ok. compare your results and verify :)

3. selling and printing - testing if you print and sell correctly. note that because the school
solution currently requires an additional  line break after choosing the option 3 - it is not
tested.

4. valgrind tests - testing whether or not you free your allocated memory. this test runs all the
tests above using valgrind and checks that you free correctly (ie, valgrind prints the sentance:
"All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible".

as ususal - don't relay solely on these tests and do some other sanity checks on your own, bla bla bla.

enjoy!
