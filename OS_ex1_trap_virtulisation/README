The program WhatIDo requires a single argument and performs the following code:
  - From the relative path the program is run, creates ./Welcome, ./WelcomeTo
  - Creates a new file ./Welcome/To/OS2020
  - Checks if the program has writing permissions
  - Writes to the file OS2020: "%username%\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it
  right now!\n1"
  - Closes the file
  - removes the file & directories created during the run
  - the program finishes
